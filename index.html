									<h1 class="major">Hello, my name<br />
									is Isaac</h1>
									<p>I am a undergraduate/aspiring computer scientist with one semester of study left. My overall GPA (3.0) is lower than my major GPA due to my first time in college as an undisciplined mechanical engineering student. I enjoy olympic-style weightlifting, military history, building and painting models, and programming war games into apps using various frameworks - currently web apps via Vue.js and mobile apps using Kotlin</p>

                                    <p> Linux (Arch, Ubuntu, Debian) 4 years experience with strong command line skills in any terminal or terminal emulator via ZSH or BASH. These skills include a by-heart memorization of the fundamental unix shell commands, an understanding of the unix file system structure, and familiarity using command line equivalents to traditional development inclulding manual compilation of code, manual initialization of projects, and vim skills so deep that I can only use other text editors after I've installed a vim emulator</p>

										<ul>
										<li> C++: This is my first and primary programming language. I work with C++ daily as a programming tutor at Del Mar College. My skills include object oriented programming in C++, creation and use of data structures, use of pthreads and modern C++11 threads as well as semaphores, mutex locks, and atomic variables.</li>
										<li> Rust: This is my favorite programming language. I have 2 years experience in Rust, and am fully familiar with its non-object-oriented, non-functional abstractions in the form of Traits and Genes that no other language uses to my knowledge. I love Rust because it is as fast as C, but is one of the easiest languages to program in due to its risk-free multithreading, zero cost abstractions, and compiler errors that are actually helpful without taking up two pages of terminal with its output.</li>
